This is a simple 2d game where you get 3 options for playing that are PlayerVPlayer, PlayerVComputer, Online PlayerVPlayer. This game is an assignment that was given by GameStacy to test my game development skill to get hire as a game developer in the company.

Hello, I am Bedaprakash Saidarsan Sahoo.
This project folder contains the game assets.
I have tried to implement all the requirements but some points I have not covered.
that are : ->
  Backtracking using stack to get the recent previous position is not implemented.
  Powerups are not implemented.
  Multiplayer is also not implemented.

As my semester exams are starting from tommorrow I have to get ready and prepare for the exam. So I am unable to make modifications further for now.
My exams will be ending on 9th or 10th of july after that  I can implement all the logics.
Majority functionalities are implemented some other functionalities are remaining that are mentioned above.

I tried to make it bug free but may be some cases occurs of getting bugs.
